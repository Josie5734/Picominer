current tasks:

    sound effects + music (all in E major hopefully, maybe E minor in underground?)

    sound effects:
        X - moving - a sound that plays every time the robot moves into empty space
        X - mining - sound for mining dirt, ores, failing to mine stone
        supports - sound for placing/removing supports
        falling - sound for stone/support shaking + impacting after falling
        jelpi - mine jelpi, save jelpi 
        dying - sound for dying 
        shop - successful/unsuccessful upgrade buying, shop open/close
        surfacing - getting to surface with ores in inventory 

    music:
        maybe one loop for above ground and one for below ground

        currently just have one loop overall

        music toggle in the menu - tried implementing, cant get it to work currently, will revisit

todo:

    balancing and testing (stats and money costs etc)

    improvements on already done features:

        improved animations? not sure i kind of like the current ones as they are

        ui bar battery sprites or rework 

        better ore distribution - e.g better ores are much rare in higher layers and get more common further down like minecraft

        clean up of code in general

        zakk feedback: gradual fade on the edge of the dark circle - note: currently not sure if this is actually possible

        have implemented use of a big table for all values of ores, couldnt figure out how to change world gen to use it, may need doing later on in clean up

        logo sprite could be animated
            maybe move up and down every few frames
            animate the little orange flames
                could be different alternated sprites or could use like a cool line systemt o draw varying length lines



ideas:

    maybe shop flies in from side (opposite side to player relative to middle)
            e.g player is left of middle, fly from right side and vice versa

    total (of each) ores mined stat tracker? and other stats too


bug list:

    --this is something that sydney encountered once - i cant seem to recreate it in any way
    energy system - dont remove energy if block above is surface when going up - prevent dying when moving from -1 to surface

    when falling it is possible to move to the side while not in line with blocks, eg not in a cell, which leads to the height being offset 
        could be fixed by having a check in the left right move that only works if the robot.y is divisible by 8

done so far:

    splash logo

    custom credit menu to be used across all pico games using the system menu

    stone gravity + supports functionality and shop upgrade option

    jelpi and jelpi block functionality

    darkcircle upgrade option in shop

    fall damage

    indicator for unmineable

    hide the underground when on the surface

    status messages (x to respawn, low battery etc)

    shop and upgrade system

    offset spawn to make sure there is a solid block underneath and prevent falling

    death / fail + respawn

    energy system

    clear inventory and add value to overall when returning to surface

    add items to inventory when mined

    placing ladders + ladder based movement

    mining function

    player gravity

    ui bar (mostly)

    collision

    camera scrolling

    underground filter

    layer0 map

    sprites for blocks (atleast for layer 0)

    layer/map generating algorithm (could be refined/improved later)(doesnt have cracked blocks)
