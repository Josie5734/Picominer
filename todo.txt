current tasks:

    stone gravity + supports functionality and shop upgrade option

    so far: 
        created list for stone objects, with update and draw functions to update and draw each objects (if any)
        function to check the block above when mining and create a new object if it is stone 
        function to animate the stone and then make it fall
        made falling feature better so that the blocks can now fall offscreen - pixel collision was detecting the black circle and triggering a collision, system now uses the map cels to see the next cell and choose to keep moving or no
        destroys ladders when falling
        squishing the robot when falling  
        status message - default when underground - ("Z - place support")
        new sprite for support + ladder
        press z to place or remove a support
        supports cannot be placed without a support or solid block below them
        reset supports when going to surface
        added supports to shop upgrades




    current:
        add supports
            supports need the same falling mechanic as stone for when the block below is mined or support below is removed
            supports stop stone falls

        added the flag check for supports in the collision check, is currently unused because supports are not added yet      

    todo:
        support placement, collision, upgrade and other related stuff
        also needs to check for any stone above the current stone - chain reaction of the check function

todo:
    
    stone gravity at some point to make supports actually have a use (putting off, seems complicated, could use exisitng gravity check)
        would also have to add supports to upgrade system if added

    sound effects + music

    balancing and testing (stats and money costs etc)

    title screens and tutorials? + win visuals?


    improvements on already done features:

        improved animations? not sure i kind of like the current ones as they are

        ui bar battery sprites or rework 

        better ore distribution - e.g better ores are much rare in higher layers and get more common further down like minecraft

        clean up of code in general

        zakk feedback: gradual fade on the edge of the dark circle - note: currently not sure if this is actually possible

        have implemented use of a big table for all values of ores, couldnt figure out how to change world gen to use it, may need doing later on in clean up



ideas:

    maybe shop flies in from side (opposite side to player relative to middle)
            e.g player is left of middle, fly from right side and vice versa

    total (of each) ores mined stat tracker? and other stats too


bug list:

    --this is something that sydney encountered once - i cant seem to recreate it in any way
    energy system - dont remove energy if block above is surface when going up - prevent dying when moving from -1 to surface

    when falling it is possible to move to the side while not in line with blocks, eg not in a cell, which leads to the height being offset 
        could be fixed by having a check in the left right move that only works if the robot.y is divisible by 8

done so far:

    jelpi and jelpi block functionality

    darkcircle upgrade option in shop

    fall damage

    indicator for unmineable

    hide the underground when on the surface

    status messages (x to respawn, low battery etc)

    shop and upgrade system

    offset spawn to make sure there is a solid block underneath and prevent falling

    death / fail + respawn

    energy system

    clear inventory and add value to overall when returning to surface

    add items to inventory when mined

    placing ladders + ladder based movement

    mining function

    player gravity

    ui bar (mostly)

    collision

    camera scrolling

    underground filter

    layer0 map

    sprites for blocks (atleast for layer 0)

    layer/map generating algorithm (could be refined/improved later)(doesnt have cracked blocks)
