current tasks:



todo:

    offset spawn to make sure there is a solid block underneath and prevent falling

    maybe lower energy cost for moving 

    shops/interactive things to sell/buy/upgrade etc

    upgrade system

    status messages (x to respawn, low battery etc)

    indicators for unmineable, no ladders etc
    
    stone gravity at some point to make supports actually have a use (putting off, seems complicated, could use exisitng gravity check)

    have implemented use of a big table for all values of ores, couldnt figure out how to change world gen to use it, may need doing later on in clean up

    improved animation?

    title screens and tutorials?

    ui bar battery sprites or rework 

    zakk feedback: gradual fade on the edge of the dark circle


ideas:

    stone gravity affected - support beam item
        while underground: UP place ladder if no ladder already, Z = place support

    a shop where you can go to reset a layer of the mine

    pico version of the big diamond is a jelpi in a block - when mined, jelpi follows you until you get him to the surface


bug list:

    energy system - dont remove energy if block above is surface when going up - prevent dying when moving from -1 to surface

    sometimes digging up removes a ladder above you
        dig 1 down - ladder up
        dig block below and go up 
        places ladder at -2 but removes at -1

done so far:

    death / fail + respawn

    energy system

    clear inventory and add value to overall when returning to surface

    add items to inventory when mined

    placing ladders + ladder based movement

    mining function

    player gravity

    ui bar (mostly)

    collision

    camera scrolling

    underground filter

    layer0 map

    sprites for blocks (atleast for layer 0)

    layer/map generating algorithm (could be refined/improved later)(doesnt have cracked blocks)
