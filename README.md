This is my first proper project made using Pico-8 

It is based off an old mobile game i used to play called Robo Miner

The goal is to mine ores, get money and upgrade the little robot, and eventually find the secret block hidden in the level

The game is not super indepth or anything, it is my first one but hopefully it still has the fun elements of the original Robo Miner
